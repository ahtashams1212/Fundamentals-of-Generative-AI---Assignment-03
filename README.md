## Fundamentals-of-Generative-AI---Assignment-03

1. What are Compound AI Systems?

Compound AI systems refer to integrated frameworks that combine multiple AI models or components to perform complex tasks.

2. What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous entities within these systems that interact with their environment and make decisions to achieve specific goals.

3. What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents?

Compound AI systems rely on AI agents to carry out various functions, with the agents working collaboratively or independently.

4. What is the difference between Fine Tuning and RAG?

The distinction between Fine-Tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lies in their approach: Fine-Tuning involves adapting a pre-trained
model to a specific task by adjusting its parameters using task-specific data, while RAG enhances model responses by incorporating external
knowledge retrieved from a database or documents during inference, without altering the model's core structure.
